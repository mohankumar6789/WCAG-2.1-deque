NOTE  00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:10.000
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Peter's been a great partner we look to
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
always have great partners we're doing a
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
lot of different projects a lot of
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
different restaurants all over the
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
country so we have a lot of different
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
needs sometimes we're looking for a
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
unique design sometimes it's a copy of a
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
design we have in one of our other
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
stores I'm always happy and pleased when
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I see great design and craftsmanship and
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
quality that holds up in the environment
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that we're in so when I see Peters work
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
you know it makes me feel great I would
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
definitely recommend Peter is firm and
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
they've been great and nothing but
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
positive things to say about them Peter
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
is an amazingly passionate guy and he
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
really cares about what he does you know
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
it's really fun when a project is done
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
we've spent the day installing furniture
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and he comes in with his piece or pieces
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and my clients are usually there and
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
they look at this piece that they've
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
heard about and all of a sudden there it
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
is and they just are in awe their eyes
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
are wide open and their jaws dropping
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and it's absolutely the best feeling I
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
could have as a designer he's just a
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
dream partner to have I know I can trust
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
him well when we were looking to move
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
our office spaces and really create a
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
new modern industrial look for our
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
offices came down to really one choice
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and that was Peter Thomas design we
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
needed a partner that could be
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
collaborative with our creative people
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
running a creative business you
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
recognize people that are open to
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
other's ideas and also brings something
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
unique to the table and we were just
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
thrilled with the result we got because
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Peter and his team are so great to work
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
with they listened hard took great notes
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and came back with something that was
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
beyond what we expected well we were
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
looking for someone to help design the
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
furniture for our home we wanted someone
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
who was really creative and who could
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
really advance their ideas and and
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
incorporate our vision for the furniture
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and how it would work in the house so in
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
terms of designing the house we really
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
wanted to bring the outdoor in and
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and the indoors out and so all of Peters
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
pieces were designed to really
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
accommodate that accommodate our friends
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and family to really appreciate the
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
outdoors we wanted each piece to be
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
unique and we wanted each piece to work
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
within that particular space within the
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
house when we have guests over they love
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
seeing Peters furniture and they
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
continue to comment on it and you know
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
ask questions about the design and how
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
it came about in my experience there's
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
no one that can compare
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
