                Peter's been a great partner we look to always have great partners
                we're doing a lot of different projects a lot of different
                restaurants all over the country so we have a lot of different
                needs sometimes we're looking for a unique design sometimes it's a
                copy of a design we have in one of our other stores I'm always
                happy and pleased when I see great design and craftsmanship and
                quality that holds up in the environment that we're in so when I
                see Peters work you know it makes me feel great I would definitely
                recommend Peter is firm and they've been great and nothing but
                positive things to say about them Peter is an amazingly passionate
                guy and he really cares about what he does you know it's really
                fun when a project is done we've spent the day installing
                furniture and he comes in with his piece or pieces and my clients
                are usually there and they look at this piece that they've heard
                about and all of a sudden there it is and they just are in awe
                their eyes are wide open and their jaws dropping and it's
                absolutely the best feeling I could have as a designer he's just a
                dream partner to have I know I can trust him well when we were
                looking to move our office spaces and really create a new modern
                industrial look for our offices came down to really one choice and
                that was Peter Thomas design we needed a partner that could be
                collaborative with our creative people running a creative business
                you recognize people that are open to other's ideas and also
                brings something unique to the table and we were just thrilled
                with the result we got because Peter and his team are so great to
                work with they listened hard took great notes and came back with
                something that was beyond what we expected well we were looking
                for someone to help design the furniture for our home we wanted
                someone who was really creative and who could really advance their
                ideas and incorporate our vision for the furniture and how it
                would work in the house so in terms of designing the house we
                really wanted to bring the outdoor in and the indoors out and so
                all of Peters pieces were designed to really accommodate that
                accommodate our friends and family to really appreciate the
                outdoors we wanted each piece to be unique and we wanted each
                piece to work within that particular space within the house when
                we have guests over they love seeing Peters furniture and they
                continue to comment on it and you know ask questions about the
                design and how it came about in my experience there's no one that
                can compare you.

              William &amp; Mary has a lot to offer, but most importantly it offers
              you a place to call home. I remember that William &amp; Mary really
              began feeling like my home when I learned to build connections with
              the people and the community here. There was a night my freshman
              year where I remember some of my friends from my freshman hall and
              I, we just went out to the Sunken Garden and just started talking a
              lot about college you know, all of our hopes our expectations, but
              also a lot of what we were nervous about, and from that night onward
              we went on to have so many memories and experiences that I can't
              imagine these past four years without them. On this tour today I've
              been able to show you a lot of really cool places around William &amp;
              Mary but it's not just the places, it's the people that make it feel
              like home. Thank you so much for coming on this tour with me today
              and we really hope to see you soon.
            </p>
